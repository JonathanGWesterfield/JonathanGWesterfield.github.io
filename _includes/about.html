                        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
                        <p>I thrive on projects that challenge what I know and which encourage me to master what I don't. 
                            From my past work and internship experiences, I have gained invaluable tools and understanding
                            that I apply to each project I take on.

                        <p>I have great customer service  and communication experience through my time at the 
                            Texas A&M Division of Student Affairs IT Service Desk. I am able to network, 
                            communicate clearly, and create rapport with customers. This also comes with 
                            strong technical communication skills. 
                            I am able to clearly convey goals and technical specifications to a group 
                            of users/customers with a broad range of technical experience. </p>

                    <h3>Leader</h3>
                    <p>When working in teams, I love leading and seeing the project start from nothing 
                        to becoming a full-fledged product. I truly believe that if the team is working 
                        well, then the project will take care of itself. To that end, I always work to 
                        ensure that my team is operating at its best, no matter what my role is. Everyone 
                        has the capacity to be a leader, in any role. </p>
