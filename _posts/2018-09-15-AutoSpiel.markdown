description: I led a team of 3 in order to build a self playing glockenspiel. The device could be placed on any 32 key glockenspiel and custom music midi files could be uploaded and played on the glockenspiel. I led the team, managed the project, and designed the circuit board. We had an article written about the project in the Texas A&amp;M Today newsletter <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2019/06/03/the-autospiel-computer-engineering-students-merge-disciplines-to-automate-music/">here</a>.
